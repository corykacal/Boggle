# Boggle
A simple GUI based boggle game. The frequencies of the letters appearing are based off of the boggle dice game to give an accurate game with a good amount of possible words.
The point system is based off of the frequencies in the english language. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency. The most uncommon letters are given two points per char in word instead of the common one. 
I am still looking for a more complete words.txt as I had to add simple words such as "peach" and "leap" to the current one.
